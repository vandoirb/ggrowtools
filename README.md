This package presents a vegetation growth model designed to be used in the Urban Environment, but is expected to work for the grass growth in general.

The model runs in two modes:
SMI | Daylength
------------ | -------------
Based on the Moisture Index (hydrological seasons) | Based on the day lenght
Jun to Aug or Sep to May | daylength > 12 or daylength <= 12

The default mode is 'SMI'.

The model can be applyed to a single area/point or over multiple polygons (using Geopandas and a Shapefile).

Examples of how to run the model are available in [the examples folder](/examples/).

The model is part of an underlying project ([SIGAVERDE](https://sigaverde.web.app/map)) developed with the support of the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and the SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). A more complete description of the model may be found in [Escobar (2019)](https://repositorio.ufscar.br/handle/ufscar/12165).
